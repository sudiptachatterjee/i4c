# Interviews for Charity

When you are looking for a job (irrespective of whether you are currently employed),
one of the most useful things to do is to practice for interviews. Preferably, with
someone from your own field.

However, nothing is free in this world. Your potential interviewer has almost no
incentive to spend time and hard-earned skills helping you, unless you are a close
friend or colleague. But why help a stranger? They can, of course, take their
time and skills to some other platform and get paid in the process. But for some of
us, that extra bit of cash is welcome; but it is not a sufficient motivator. We want to
do good for the world, within the realm of our limited skills on the earth.

This is where Interviews for Charity (I4C) comes into the picture. As a potential
interviewer, you spend your time helping other candidates prepare for their future
jobs, but you personally don't make any money in the process. What you do have is
a promise from the candidate: to donate to a charity of your choice when they get a
job. As a candidate: it is very simple - when you get a job and draw a salary, you
should donate to all the charities that your interviewers nominated and you agreed
upon.

It is a pinky-swear, to be honest, and therefore unenforceable. But hopefully you
can bet a little bit of your time to help other humans, and they can, in turn, pass
it forward.

Personally, I am using this project to learn ReactJS + NextJS and Material UI. And the
backend is going to be some kind of Python + FastAPI. I have been told that the
best way to learn React is to build something, however weird it might be. And this
shall the be the first ugly / weird child: but it shall be one nonetheless!

Default charity: [Promise Worldwide](https://www.promiseworldwide.org). They are
bringing education to girls in underprivileged communities in India, helping with
menstrual products, and overall a force for good in the world. Donate there right now
if you can!

And wish me luck ðŸ˜Š
